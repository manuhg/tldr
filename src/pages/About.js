        Say hi to the amazing people who want to make earth smart again! The long time conspiracy of
        aliens creating un tolerably long documents and traffic jams to deter normal sapiens from
        acquring more knowlegde on daily basis has been exposed! Hail the people below who have
        accepted the challenge to make the world a better place by inducing common knowlegde and
        general sense in form of a few sentences instead of long documents called the news paper
        articles. Wait till we roll out beta version before signing the next EULA!.
